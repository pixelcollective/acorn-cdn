# Acorn CDN

Lightweight CDN mechanism for Acorn projects.

## Requirements

[Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) >= 10.0

[PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 7.3

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

## Notes

After installation run `wp acorn vendor:publish` to copy the `cdn.php` configuration file to your `config` directory. It's pretty self-explanatory from there.
